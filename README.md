# Overview

	January 27th. 2025:

	Beginning to implement the fileReader class and main.cpp file which includes the FileReader. FilReader takes in a filename in
    order to initialize an ifstream and parse through the string tokens within the file.

    Functionality - 
            *Counts the number of unique token occurrences in the map.
            *Sort the set of tokens by occurrence from most to least. Print the results.
            *Finds the ten tokens with the most characters, sorted from highest to lowest.
            *Finds the token with the most repeated characters.

# Estimated/Worked         Note

	6/2                     Spent a good chunk of time deciding how to organize the files.
